Use my theory of "Broad Evolution" to design programs which can not only breed but also evolve and at last create an AI with this theory.
More information about my theory of "Broad Evolution",see my blog at http://hi.baidu.com/hkuieagle/home .


OOPS! Recently, I found that this theory is called "Evolutionary computation" which was already under development around 1930s! What's more, the first chapter of that book is unbelievably extremely almost the SAME with what I wrote in my blog!
